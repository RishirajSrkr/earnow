            Accessing and rectifying Your personal information<br>
            <br>

            When You use the Services Website/application (or any of its sub sites), We make good faith efforts to
            provide You, as and when requested by You, with access to Your personal information and shall further ensure
            that any personal information or sensitive personal data or information found to be inaccurate or deficient
            shall be corrected or amended as feasible. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the
            information requested to be accessed or corrected before processing such requests. We may decline to process
            requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, requiring disproportionate technical effort,
            jeopardizing the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
            information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where We
            provide information access and correction, We perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would
            require a disproportionate effort.<br>
            <br>


            You can make access requests by sending an e-mail to us. You will get a link on Your registered Email
            address through which You can access all the personal data Earnow collects and stores about You.<br>
            <br>


            You can ask Us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information<br>
            <br>

            reflected across all properties.<br>
            <br>

            Concerning details that are separately collected and maintained by RealCash, by sending an e-mail to Our
            support team at enquiry@realcashapp.in to perform the rectification.<br>

            structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format; wherever feasible. If You are registered on the
            Website , then you can request for a copy of this information by writing to Us at contact@earnow.in<br>

            Data Retention and Erasure<br>
            <br>

            We retain Your personal information as long as necessary for Us to provide Services to You, to comply with
            the applicable laws or till You ask Us to not retain Your data. If You no longer want Us to use Your
            information, then You can request that We erase Your personal information and close Your Website account.
            Please note that if You request for the erasure of Your personal information;<br>
            <br>


            We may retain some of Your personal information as necessary for Our legitimate business interests, such as
            fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if We suspend the Website account for
            fraud or safety reasons, We may retain certain information from that account to prevent that user from
            opening a new account in the future.
            We may retain and use Your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with Our legal
            obligations. For example, We may keep some of Your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing
            obligations.<br>
            <br>

            Information You have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible
            on the Website, even after Your account is cancelled. However, attribution of such information to You will
            be removed. Additionally, some copies of Your information (e.g., log records) may remain in Our database,
            but are disassociated from personal identifiers.<br>
            <br>

            Because We maintain copies of personal information to protect from accidental or malicious loss and
            destruction, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from Our active servers and
            may remain in Our backup systems.<br>
            <br>

            You can request for deletion of Your information by writing to us at contact@earnow.in. Your request will be
            processed and You will receive confirmation of the same via email. Please note that this will only perform a
            deletion of the information that has been collected by Earnow and will disable Your login information for
            Earnow<br>
            <br>

            deliver certain experiences, and services to You, and some of Our services may not be able to take account
            of Your interests and preferences. If collection of personal information is mandatory, We will make that
            clear at the point of collection so that You can make an informed decision whether to participate. If You

            regarding that personal information, please contact Us at the below mentioned e-mail address.<br>

            extension, as provided under GDPR.<br>
            <br>


            We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or

            does not knowingly permit any person who is under 12 (Twelve) years of age to register with the services or
            to provide any other personally identifying information. If Earnow becomes aware that any personally
            identifiable information of persons less than 12 (Twelve) years of age has been collected on the Website /
            Mobile Apps without verified parental consent, then Earnow will take the appropriate steps to delete any

            firewall on the cloud; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as
            effective as Our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. If You know or have reason to
            believe that Your Earnow account credentials have been lost, stolen, altered, or otherwise compromised or in
